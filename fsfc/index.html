<h1>Darkness threatens the world... <span>A Primer on SuperFunCon!</span></h1>
<p class="story">That the world will come to destruction is not a matter of if, but when.  The forces of chaos live off war, magik, and instability.  And the temptation of Man, knowing no boundary, can lead to but one inevitable, tragic conclusion.  Our greed and hatred fuel the flames that will engulf the world and ultimately rip open the very fabric of the cosmos.</p>
<p class="story">Will you fight alongside the dying race of Man, and struggle to preserve order and stability in your lands until the very end?  Or perhaps instead you will choose the path of avarice, and grow your power and might recklessly with no regard for Nature and Law?  Or most nefarious of all, will you explictly choose the path of Darkness, and undermine the noble forces of Law, manipulating ever larger and more terrible battles, casting powerful and destructive magicks, and sending cultists into peaceful cities to spread terror and disease?

<h2>Strategic Campaigns</h2>
<p>
Battles in SuperFunCon take place on a huge map with complex, realistic geographic features.  Attacking another player isn't a simple click of the mouse, but rather players must take into consideration numerous factors, such as terrain, fog of war, season, encumbrance, and man-made defenses.

<h2>Level up Heroes and Craftsmen</h2>
<p><strong>Send your heroes on quests.</strong>  <em>Win battles.</em>  Discover <em>ancient</em> and <strong>forgotten arts</strong> - such as the art of steel forging, or the manufakture of elven long bows.  Discover a Mithril mine, and hire or train a master blacksmith to craft powerful armor for your heroes and crack guards.</p><p>

<h2>Resource Management</h2>
<p>
Send workers from you towns and cities into remote wilderness areas to harvest rare and exotic resources.  Or just build up huge stockpiles of basic commodities like stone and wood.  Use resources to build improvements in your kingdom, and items and weapons for your soldiers and heroes.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Absolutely Massive.</h2>
<p>Play online in a persistent world with thousands of other players.  Build ocean-worthy ships and explore exotic new continents.  Bring back strange new materials and talents that will give you a cultural or military edge against the other players.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Trade resources, but guard your caravans!</h2>
<p>Consider it a given that you won't have direct access to every resource you need to be competitive in the game.  Developing productive trade relationships with other players can strengthen both parties, helping each on their path to becoming a Legendary ruler.  But make sure you guard your trade routes heavily - or your caravans may be ambushed by monsters for an easy snack, or other players looking for power the lazy way.</p>

<h2>Manage your armies wisely</h2>
<p>
Examine your cities' populations.  Find promising soldiers and group them together into effective units.  Create units of archers or knights or footmen, based on fighting attributes like Pace, MeleeSkill and Toughness.  But be careful!  Your soldiers are part of your cities, and if you kill them rashly in foolish wars, your cities will suffer their lack of peace time contributions.</p>
<p>
Quickly equip and configure your units through the War Council dialog.  Drag and drop weapons, armor and other items you build or trade for onto units.  However, be wary!  Over encumbering your troops will slow them down, which could prove disastrous for your kingdom!</p>

<section>
<h2>Become a Cultural Center</h2>
<p>Build museums, cathedrals, libraries and universities, and compete to be the Cultural Center of the World.  But you have to start small, and grow your cities wisely - just focus on military growth and watch your kingdom's influence dwindle, as the great Heroes of the world chooes to live, fight and die for other legendary civilizations.
